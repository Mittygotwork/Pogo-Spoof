# Pogo-Spoof

1. Jailbreak iOS device
- Identify your device and OS and google how to jailbreak it. I will go over mine specifically
- I have an iPad 5th Gen, running 16.7.8. 
- Googling will tell you to use ‘Palerain’ , however it will also tell you that is only available on Mac/Linux
- This is false, I googled palerain for windows and after some clicks I was actually able to get a video that shows it step by step on YouTube (no links allowed)
- The video will give you the file to extract and the password to u lock. It will say to turn off your antivirus, but I didn’t do that and had no issue.
- One issue I had was an error saying my device was disconnected during the jailbreak. After googling, I found the issue is the SDkeys file(s). Simply google these (or find download on YouTube) and manually run. Then rerun the jailbreak
- Follow the steps and let it finish. When complete, your device will look like it is being hacked and then load in iOS (about 10 seconds, don’t freak)
- You should now have a jailbroken device. To confirm, check that the Palerain app is on your Home Screen (rainbow)
2. Spoofing
- now that you’re jailbroken, you can install the apps to spoof
- The jailbroken loader you will need is called “troll store”. To get this app, search troll helper/troll store shortcut on safari. Add this as a shortcut on your device and the apps should appear
- Now that you have the loader, go to spooferpro.com
- Download latest ipa and join discord (free plus support)
- Open troll store and add the IPA file
- Cracked pokemongo should now load
